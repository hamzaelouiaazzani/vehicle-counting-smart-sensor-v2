    "This notebook provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run the vehicle counting application on four different platforms: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebooks, and via Bash/Linux commands and in  NANO JETSON Kit.\n",
    "## 1.1. Google Colab\n",
    "**Note:** Please don't forget to set the runtime type to **GPU (T4)** in Colab for optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting the Runtime to GPU (T4):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After the notebook opens, navigate to the top menu and select **Runtime** > **Change runtime type**.\n",
    "2. In the popup window, set **Hardware accelerator** to **GPU**.\n",
    "3. If available, select **T4** as the GPU type.\n",
    "4. Run the below code cells after setting .yaml config file with target rois, lines and params\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In case you want to use the Geoforce GPU in your computer to accelerate to speed up processing, kindly install CUDA in your computer \n",
    "Follow these steps to set up and run the application in Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using a GeForce GPU in your computer for Accelerated Processing  \n",
    "\n",
    "To utilize your computer's GeForce GPU to speed up processing, follow these steps:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install CUDA:**  \n",
    "   Download and install the CUDA toolkit compatible with your GPU from the [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit Archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-4-0-download-archive).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install PyTorch with GPU Support:**  \n",
    "   Visit [PyTorch's Get Started Guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install the appropriate version of PyTorch for your system with GPU (CUDA) support.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes  \n",
    "- Ensure your GPU driver is up-to-date before installing CUDA.  \n",
    "- Follow the instructions on the linked pages carefully to avoid compatibility issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Create Virtual Environment (Bash/Anaconda Prompt)\n",
    "Open a Bash or Anaconda Prompt and run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment named `vehicle_counter`:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create --name vehicle_counter python=3.8\n",
    "conda activate vehicle_counter\n",
    "```\n",
    "This step assumes you have already installed Anaconda in your computer\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** You can neglect the above two instructions if you are NOT working in a virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Clone the Vehicle Counting Repository\n",
    "Clone the repository and ensure that vehicle-counting-smart-sensor-v2 is set as your working directory if you haven't done so already.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "!git clone https://github.com/hamzaelouiaazzani/vehicle-counting-smart-sensor-v2.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Upgrade pip and Install Dependencies\n",
    "Download/clone the repository and run the following cell to upgrade pip, setuptools, and wheel, and install the repository dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "!pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel\n",
    "!pip install -e .\n",
    "```\n",
    "> **Note:** Once you run this cell, comment it out and do not run it again because the packages are already installed in your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Verify Torch Installation\n",
    "Run the following cell to confirm that NumPy version 1.24.4 is installed, PyTorch is set up, and CUDA is available for GPU support.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "print(\"NumPy Version:\", np.__version__)\n",
    "\n",
    "from IPython.display import Image, clear_output  # to display images in Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "clear_output()\n",
    "\n",
    "import torch\n",
    "print(f\"Cuda availaibility: {torch.cuda.is_available()}\")\n",
    "if torch.cuda.is_available():\n",
    "    print(f\"Setup complete. Using torch {torch.__version__} ({torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).name if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'CPU'})\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: set the .yaml config file with target rois, lines and params\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Verify Torch Installation\n",
    "Run the below engine code cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3. Running the Repository on NANO JETSON Kit\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps to set up and run the repository on a NANO JETSON Developer Kit with GPU support.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Download cuSPARSElt\n",
    "Download cuSPARSElt to enable GPU usage with PyTorch and TorchVision:\n",
    "- Visit the following link: [cuSPARSElt Downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/cusparselt-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=aarch64-jetson&Compilation=Native&Distribution=Ubuntu&target_version=22.04&target_type=deb_network)\n",
    "- Ensure the file is compatible with your setup.\n",
    "- Make sure the file `cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb` (or a similar one) is successfully downloaded to your JETSON NANO Kit root: \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment\n",
    "1. Create a new virtual environment:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python3 -m venv vehicle_counter\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. Activate the virtual environment:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   source vehicle_counter/bin/activate\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Check the NVIDIA Forum\n",
    "Refer to the following NVIDIA forum for compatible PyTorch and TorchVision Wheel files:\n",
    "- [PyTorch for Jetson](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/pytorch-for-jetson/72048)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Download Required Files\n",
    "Download the following files:\n",
    "- PyTorch Wheel: `torch-2.3.0-cp310-cp310-linux_aarch64.whl`\n",
    "- TorchVision Wheel: `torchvision-0.18.0a0+6043bc2-cp310-cp310-linux_aarch64.whl`\n",
    "- These files are compatible with JetPack 6.1, Ubuntu 22.04, CUDA 12.6, and Jetson Linux L4T R36.4.\n",
    "\n",
    "If these versions do not work, refer back to the forum for other compatible versions. If no prebuilt versions are suitable, you can build PyTorch and TorchVision from source by using these repositories:\n",
    "- [PyTorch Source Repository]( https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)\n",
    "- [TorchVision Source Repository](https://github.com/pytorch/vision)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Clone the Repository\n",
    "Clone the repository to your Jetson Kit:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "!git clone https://github.com/hamzaelouiaazzani/vehicle-counting-smart-sensor-v2.git\n",
    "cd vehicle-counting-smart-sensor-v2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Install Dependencies\n",
    "Upgrade pip, setuptools, and wheel, then install the repository dependencies:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel\n",
    "pip install -e .\n",
    "cd ..\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: Verify Installation\n",
    "Run the following commands to confirm installation:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3 -c \"import torch; print('PyTorch version:', torch.__version__); print('CUDA available:', torch.cuda.is_available())\"\n",
    "python3 -c \"import torchvision; print('TorchVision version:', torchvision.__version__)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "The installation of PyTorch and TorchVision using the previous instructions enables only CPU functionality on your NANO Jetson Kit, not GPU support. To confirm this, run the following command. If GPU is not enabled, it will display “CUDA available: False”.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 8: Enable GPU Support\n",
    "Install the appropriate PyTorch and TorchVision versions for GPU support:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip3 install torch-2.3.0-cp310-cp310-linux_aarch64.whl\n",
    "pip3 install torchvision-0.18.0a0+6043bc2-cp310-cp310-linux_aarch64.whl\n",
    "pip install numpy==1.24.4\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Step 9: set the .yaml config file with target rois, lines and params"

    "\n",
    "- **Interactive GUI:** The selectors and `cv2.imshow` require a desktop session. They will not work on headless servers unless you use a virtual display (e.g., Xvfb on Linux).\n",
    "- **VideoWriter:** The notebook uses `mp4v` fourcc. If output fails to open, confirm codecs are available on your platform. The code asserts `video_writer.isOpened()`.\n",
    "- **Stopping:** Press **`q`** in the OpenCV window to stop early. The `finally` block ensures `frame_grabber.release()`, `video_writer.release()` and `cv2.destroyAllWindows()` are called.\n",
    "- **Paths:** Use absolute paths for `source` to avoid accidental wrong working directory problems.\n",
    "- **GPU:** For real-time performance use CUDA-enabled PyTorch and Ultralytics. Confirm `my_model.predictor.device` shows `cuda`.\n",
